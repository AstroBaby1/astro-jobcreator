# astro-jobcreator
Astro-JobCreator is a resource for FiveM that allows server administrators to easily create custom jobs and assign bosses for them. It also includes a boss menu for changing stash and garage coordinates and a marker for accessing the stash. The script uses QBcore as its base and is easily customizable for server needs.
